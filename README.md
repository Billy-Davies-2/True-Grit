# True-Grit
A bot for Discord for the students in the UMBC community. This bot is made using JS, Python, and anything else we can find to make it work. 

The purpose of this is to give people in the clubs around campus something that they can plug into their Discord servers as a bot to either help them get started, or give them ideas on what they might want to build into their servers.
